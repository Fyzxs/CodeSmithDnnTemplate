CodeSmithDnnTemplate
====================

CodeSmith template for producing shell of a new DotNetNuke modules

This is a module template from around DNN 5/6 that I used to produce the core of a large number of modules. It was used heavily around 2009; so it's been a while.

It probably has some pieces that don't make sense except to me.

This was last run against CodeSmith 5.2.3; so no promises on future version (or really, that one). 

I haven't used this for quite a while - It does function; but no proimises on exactly how. I was in the middle of upgrading to some WebAPI stuff in newer DNN when I no longer had time to work on this.
